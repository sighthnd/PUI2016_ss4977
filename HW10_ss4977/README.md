## First run-through
Completed both assignments by myself and shared the results with Sebastian Gutierrez, Jonathan Geis, Sofiya Elyukin, Tyler Woekenberg, Marc Toneatto, Bailey Griswold, and Ben Alpert. Gained feedback that pointed out that the overall data and the seasonal data were to be processed in separate files. Further discussion raised questions as to whether we were supposed to use sum() or mean() for each station.

## Second run-through
After brief discussions with the group, continued on my own.

#### Assignment 1
With uncertainty as to whether sum() or mean() was appropriate, I produced parallel plots of each. The work dataset for mean() was produced excluding months for each station with 0 ridership. Differences between the two include: using mean() put the Upper East and Upper West Sides in a higher decile and Downtown Brooklyn in a lower decile, most of scatter points were closer closer to the regression line for mean(), and using mean() resulted in an additional hotspot at the lower part of Central Park West and coldspots disappearing in Greenpoint and along Park Avenue roughly between 60th and 80th Streets.

#### Assignment 2
Differences between Winter and Summer: Winter has a greater share of rides coming from the courts area of Manhattan and the West Village and Summer has a greater share of rides coming from the Hudson waterfront and Columbus Circle. Summer had a greater spatial lag along the Hudson waterfront. Summer had additional hotspots in Battery Park City and the lower part of Central Park West and was missing a coldspot in Long Island City while having a wider and more intense cold spot east of Downtown Brooklyn.
