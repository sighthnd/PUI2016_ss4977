#Scott Smith's Plot Review
<c>![Screenshot 1 Assignment 2: my .bashrc](https://github.com/wbx200/PUI2016_wbx200/blob/master/HW8_wbx200/ss4977%20Plot.png?raw=true)</c>
<br><br>
Scott’s plot is properly labelled (title, axes, legend, and units) and the color scheme is effective in differentiating the various data points.  Scott also included a caption which both describes the plot and conveys the key takeaway – the Central Limit Theorem and what it means for the data convergence.
<br><br>	The one recommendation that I have is to highlight the skew information a little more so that it stands out from the rest of the plot.  For example, the skew data points, “skew = 0” line, and right y-axis labels and title can all be highlighted in red – thus differentiating it even more from the mean and variance information on the left y-axis.
